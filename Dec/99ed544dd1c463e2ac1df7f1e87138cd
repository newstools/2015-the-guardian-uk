Four of the world’s biggest tobacco companies have gone to the high court to challenge the lawfulness of the government’s new plain packaging rules. The regulations, which come into force in May next year, ban logos or branding on tobacco products. Mr Justice Green is being asked to rule on the legality of the measures in a judicial review action by Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International. The challenge is being contested by the heath secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who argues that the regulations are lawful. At the start of an estimated six-day hearing, David Anderson QC, for Japan Tobacco International, told a packed court: “The claimants manufacture products which are lawful, which contribute approximately £10bn per year in excise duty alone for the UK exchequer, which are used by some 19% of the adult population, and which the secretary of state … has never sought to ban.” Referring to written legal submissions, the QC said Hunt was “quite wrong when he says that we are trying to protect our ability to market unencumbered by legitimate legislation”. He said the industry was “regulated in a way almost unprecedented in any other field”. At the heart of the case are the standardised packaging of tobacco products regulations 2015, which the government argues will discourage people from smoking.
